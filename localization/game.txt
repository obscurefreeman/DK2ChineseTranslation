@grenade_stingersingle_name=1x Stinger
@grenade_stinger_name=2x Stinger
@grenade_stinger_desc=A not-really-lethal grenade that explodes into a swarm of "harmless" rubber balls, stinging people and causing them to flee and take cover - if they can still walk, that is.\n\nUse Stingers to scare off civilians and troublemakers and clear your line of fire, but don't drop them on top of people you care about.\n\nFuse time: 1s\nEffective Range: 4m\nInjury Range: 1m
@grenade_fragsingle_name=1x Frag Grenade
@grenade_frag_name=2x Frag Grenade
@grenade_frag_desc=The standard grenade you throw to blow people up. Will fill anyone caught within killing range with deadly metal FRAGments. Does not forgive, does not care.

@slap_charge_name=1x Slap Charge
@slap_charge_desc=A small self-adhesive explosive charge you slap on the door to blow the lock off.

Can also be used to clear windows for entry.\n\nPlacement time: 2.5s
@nws_doorcharge_name=1x Door Charge
@nws_doorcharge_kit_name=4x Door Charge
@nws_doorcharge_desc=A medium size explosive charge balanced against the door to blow it off completely. Projects debris and splinter and creates overpressure in the area directly behind the door, so it is not safe to use near friendlies or non-combatants.\n\nPlacement time: 5s\nKill Range: 3.5m\nInjury Range: 7m
@gear_torch_name=1x Thermal Torch
@gear_torch_desc=A self-contained, disposable torch that literally burns through padlocks, metal doors and chainlink fences alike.\n\nWill create a light-and-sound show for the benefit of the enemy, so use only when stealth is not important.\n\nUse time: 3s\n\n*not a lightsaber!

@helmet_rangers_ach_name=Low-Cut Helmet
@helmet_rangers_ach_desc=The Army's standard helmet for the Nowheraki Campaign, the LCH covers the vital parts of the head with level IIIA protection, without interfering with your combat vision and rifle cheek-weld.\n\nHas a 15% chance to stop critical shots from pistols and submachineguns.
@helmet_nws_ach_desc=Surplus helmet from the US Army, conveniently assigned to you on the Sappers course.\n\nA bit on the heavy side, but your SWAT buddies still wish they could get one of their own.\n\nHas a 14% chance to stop critical shots from pistols and submachineguns.
@helmet_nws_achlow_desc=With great effort not limited to bribes and string pulling of the highest level, you've got surplus helmets for the entire team.\n\nThey are a bit heavy and they were not kept in the best conditions, but still have a 12% chance to stop critical shots from pistols and submachineguns.
@helmet_rangers_ihps_name=Next-Gen Helmet
@helmet_rangers_ihps_desc=Available for testing in limited quantity, the Next Gen Helmet takes advantage of very modern tech to provide an enlarged protected area and level III protection with minimal weight increase.\n\nHas a 20% chance to stop critical shots from non-AP OpFor weapons, including AKs and similar.
@helmet_rangers_fast_name=High-Cut Helmet
@helmet_rangers_fast_desc=The new helmet coming into service with the Ranger Regiment, the High-Cut trades a bit of protection for mobility.\n\nThe ballistic protection is just level II, but it can still stop most pistol and SMG rounds.\n\n10% chance to block critical shots.
@helmet_rangers_fastrf_name=Rifle Grade High-Cut
@helmet_rangers_fastrf_desc=An upgraded version of the proven High-Cut design, the RGHC gains a bit in weight to provide level III ballistic protection.\n\n10% chance to block critical shots from all pistols, submachineguns and most OpFor Assault Weapons.
@helmet_rangers_fastmandible_name=High-Cut+Mandible
@helmet_rangers_fastmandible_desc=Take advantage of the modular High-Cut helmet design to add an optional mandible area protection.\n\nThe flexible surface does not affect your weapon aiming or Field of View but it lowers your high-speed factor slightly.\n\nMost importantly, it increases your level II protected area - for a total of 14% chance to stop incoming critical shots.
@helmet_CIA_fast_name=Ballistic Helmet
@helmet_CIA_fast_desc=A Special Forces-grade helmet for protection against ballistic and explosive threats, at the expense of a little mobility.\n\nThe level IIIA shell has a chance to stop critical shots from pistols and submachineguns.\n\nAlso gives you the ability to mount Night Vision Goggles.

@helmet_NWS_basiccap_name=Baseball Cap
@helmet_NWS_basiccap_desc=Keep sun, debris and flying brass out of your eyes with this trendy, official issue SWAT cap.\n\nProvides no ballistic resistance but doesn't slow you down either.

@hat_santa_desc=Ho, ho, ho?

@nvg_rangers_pvs14_name=PVS-14 Single-Tube NVG
@nvg_rangers_pvs14_desc=The basic single-tube helmet mounted Night Vision device takes advantage of 3rd generation technology to deliver a crisp and clear image in the dark, but reduces movement speed due to the limited Field Of View and lack of depth perception.\n\nAllows you to engage enemies in the dark while remaining hidden yourself - until you open fire.
@nvg_rangers_pvs31_name=PVS-31 Dual-Tube NVG
@nvg_rangers_pvs31_desc=An advanced dual-tube helmet mounted Night Vision device offers a larger field of view and decent depth perception, so can be used with almost no movement penalties.\n\nAllows you to engage enemies in the dark while remaining hidden yourself - until you open fire.

@armor_rangers_basicvest_name=Rangers Vest / SAPI
@armor_rangers_basicvest_desc=Just the Modular Plate Carrier you were issued by the Regiment, what did you really expect? Flannel Daddy's gear closet?\n\nYou do get a pair of Level III plates to the front and back, and a bit of pistol caliber protection elsewhere.\n\nRemember -  trusting Armor is a game of chance, its your tactics that keep you alive!
@armor_rangers_levelIVaddon_name=Rangers Vest / ESAPI
@armor_rangers_levelIVaddon_desc=Replace the Hard Armor plates in your vest with the slightly heavier ESAPIs and thus gain Level IV protection - good versus Armor Piercing and Sniper threats.\n\nThe plates only cover your front and rear vital zones, and there's plenty of 'you' that stays uncovered by anything except good old ripstop fabric.
@armor_rangers_levelIVsides_name=All-around ESAPI
@armor_rangers_levelIVsides_desc=Mount ESAPI plates in all standard pockets of your Regiment-issued vest, including front, rear and the large side inserts.\n\nYou'll lose some comfort and tactical mobility, but when the Armor Piercing threat is significant, you better buckle up.
@armor_rangers_extended_name=Extended Vest / SAPI
@armor_rangers_extended_desc=When the MRAP drops you at Tango's door, there's not much point in going light, but there's plenty of reasons to armor up as each door could lead to an enemy ambush!\n\nAdd side plates, groin, deltoids and collar protection to your vest, and leave mobility and fast flanking moves to your buddies.\n\nThe vest excels at stopping rifle shots from the front, but won't stop enemy sniper rounds or Armor Piercing ammo.
@armor_rangers_jumpable_name=Raid Vest / Level III
@armor_rangers_jumpable_desc=When you got to move faster than the enemy reacts but you still want some rifle threat protection, a minimalistic Plate Carrier can be the way to go.\n\nA pair of standalone Level III plates protect your vitals from incoming Kalash fire but your flanks are completely unprotected.\n\nJust repeat 'keep in cover, move fast, shoot first, die last' till it becomes second nature, and hopefully you won't die at all.
@armor_rangers_jump_swimmeriv_name=Raid Vest / Level IV
@armor_rangers_jump_swimmeriv_desc=For discerning users, the Swimmer-cut multi-curve Level IV plates provide protection from Sniper-grade and Armor Piercing projectiles - without sacrificing much mobility, as they literally have their corners cut for improved weapons manipulation and overall comfort.\n\nThe Fast Raid platform still provides no side protection and only keeps your vitals covered, so if you have to get shot, better hope the enemy aims true and does not miss!
@armor_rangers_noplates_name=Soft Armor Only
@armor_rangers_noplates_desc=Take out the Hard Armor Plates in your vest,hoping that if you keep the level IIIA soft armor backers the Sarge won't notice how much of an idiot you truly are.\n\nYou'll gain some mobility for sure but, remember, Nowheraki Insurgents shop at AKs-r-rUs and their rounds punch right through this vest.\n\nOld soldiers tell you the best armor is not being shot at all, so move fast and get off  the X and inside the enemy's OODA loop.
@armor_no_armour_name=No Armor
@armor_cia_tacvestIII_name=Tac Vest / Level III
@armor_cia_tacvestIII_desc=A high-end plate carrier with all-around level III protection, including front, back and underarm side plates.\n\nWill reliably stop incoming fire from your run-of-the-mill AK, but keep in mind the focus is on mobility, not invulnerability - even if your vitals are covered, you're still made of flesh.\n\nDon't even think about special threats, though - if sniper fire is coming, use suppression and mobility to stay alive.
@armor_cia_tacvestIV_name=Tac Vest / Level IV
@armor_cia_tacvestIV_desc=When the going gets really tough but the mission still needs doing, all-around level IV protection might save the day.\n\nWill stop most special threats including the dreaded 7.62 Rimmed from the SVD sniper rifles and PK family machineguns, but don't let that fool you into a false sense of security. The vest stops under your neck, and the head is 'out there, in harm's way'.
@armor_cia_concealableII_name=Level II Soft Armor
@armor_cia_concealableII_desc=A thin concealable armor vest that should go unnoticed under most clothing styles, and let you get close to the enemy without raising suspicions too soon.\n\nIn this line of work, its best to not get shot at by anyone, but the vest does stop your average pistol and SMG round even point blank.\n\nRifles and full size SMGs like the Mp5A will pierce right through, however.
@armor_cia_concealableIIIAlimited_name=Level IIIA Soft Panels
@armor_cia_concealableIIIAlimited_desc=When going undercover, the distance between a succesfull infiltration and a deadly gunfight is sometimes measured in seconds. Gunfighter skills help to stay alive, but so does good planning and a bit of armor.\n\nThis undershirt maximizes concealment while keepin a pair of level IIIA panels to the front and back of your torso, covering your vitals from pistol and SMG threats.
@armor_cia_concealableIIIA_name=Level IIIA Soft Armor
@armor_cia_concealableIIIA_desc=The thickest soft armor vest you can conceal and get away with it, it offers all-around protection against pistol caliber threats and keeps you too warm during those hot days out in the sunny Nowheraki countryside.
@armor_nws_frontplate_name=Single SAPI Plate
@armor_nws_frontplate_desc=Drop a single armor plate of unknown origin into your equally no-name load bearing vest - and always keep front-towards-enemy.\n\nThe plate was SAPI certified some ages ago - so it has a reasonable chance to stop hits from AKs and other rifles.\n\nIt won't do much good against Armor Piercing threats, but in Urban Warfare, a little armor is always better than none.
@armor_nws_basicvest_name=SAPI Front / Back
@armor_nws_basicvest_desc=You're in luck and have scavanged two SAPI-style plates of reasonable quality.\n\nThis will stop rifle fire from the front and back, but it won't protect your sides nor will it stop sniper and Armor Piercing threats.
@armor_nws_extended_name=Sappers Combat Vest
@armor_nws_extended_desc=The Combat Sapper Course Patch came permanently attached to this Extended Vest, and you get to wear it due to the dangerous nature of your job.\n\nThe vest offers reasonable rifle-grade protection from the front and back, but also covers the sides to some extent.\n\nThe vest sacrifices a lot of mobility, but Sappers are too valuable to be rabbits anyway.
@armor_nws_lvl4front_name=ESAPI / SAPI Combo
@armor_nws_lvl4front_desc=Sniper-grade protection is hard to come by, but your American advisors have slipped you some plates for the team.\n\nThis will stop Armor Piercing fire from the front quarter, but the backside remains covered with only rifle-grade protection.
@armor_enemy_softarmor_name=Concealable Soft Armor
@armor_enemy_heavyarmor_name=Minimalistic Plate Carrier

@shield_nws_lvl3_name=Level III Shield
@shield_nws_lvl3_desc=A simple, rectangular shield that blocks most incoming rifle fire from the front, but doesn't stop Armor Piercing threats.\n\nBallistic Shields are not common in Middle East urban warfare, but can help against barricaded shooters or when crossing specific danger areas.
@shield_nws_lvl4_name=Level IV Shield
@shield_nws_lvl4_desc=Special delivery from our Coalition instructors, the level IV shield can stop even the dreaded Armor Piercing SVDs.\n\nSuch protection comes with a big weight penalty, so the actual shield surface is smaller and you need to be more careful to not expose your flanks to enemy fire.\n\nShields can help you cross danger areas or approach single threats, but never forget to support your shield guy with additional troops, and watch your flanks.


@armor_no_armour_desc=<OLD!>Who needs armor when bearing a big shield?\n\nNo investment needed but you DO need to pull\nsome strings if you intend to go out naked.
@armor_low_thread_armor_name=Low Threat Armor
@armor_low_thread_armor_desc=<OLD!>Soft armor vest covering the officer's\nvital zones with all around Level IIIA\nprotection.\n\nWill reliably stop impacts from handgun\nand submachinegun threats, but cannot match\nrifle projectiles.
@armor_assaulter_vest_name=Assaulter Vest
@armor_assaulter_vest_desc=<OLD!>Add a pair of Level III Hard Armor plates\nto the vest, protecting the officer's vital\norgans.\n\nWill stop rifle impacts coming from\nthe front and back quarters, while other\ndirections are protected from pistol\ncaliber threats.
@armor_raider_vest_name=Raider Vest
@armor_raider_vest_desc=<OLD!>Minimalistic all-or-nothing Level III plate\ncarrier that trades protection for mobility\nby removing all side armor.\n\nWill stop rifle caliber threats from the\nfront and rear, but leaves the side quarters\ncompletely vulnerable.
@armor_front_plate_only_name=Front Plate Only
@armor_front_plate_only_desc=<OLD!>'I don't know about you, Grimesy, I don't\nplan to get shot in the back, running away'\n\nRemove the Level III plate in the back of\nyour armor to save some weight and regain\nsome mobility.
@armor_extended_protection_name=Extended Protection
@armor_extended_protection_desc=<OLD!>For when you need to pass the gates of fire.\n\nA full featured armor set, covering the\nofficer's vitals, groin, neck and shoulders\nwith Level III and IIIA armor.\n\nWill stop rifle impacts coming from all\ndirections.
@support_gear_spy_camera_name=Spy Camera
@support_gear_spy_camera_desc=An inconspicuous camera head that fits under most doors (and, guess what, around corners!), allowing you to see into the unknown.\n\nYour soldiers will automatically turn to check "red ghosts" - the last known positions of bad guys, so intel helps clear rooms faster, safer, and with less collateral.\n\nUse it to recon rooms and danger zones - when you have time to spare.
@support_gear_lockpic_name=Lockpick
@utility_pouch_tazer_name=Tazer
@utility_pouch_tazer_desc=<OLD!>A reloadable less lethal weapon that sends\na pair of electrodes flying into the target\nand electroshocks him into submission.\n\nThe target will become unconscious but the\neffects wear off in 10 seconds, time you\nshould use to handcuff the suspect.\n\nMaximum shooting range: 7m
@utility_pouch_lockpick_machine_name=Lockpick Machine
@utility_pouch_lockpick_machine_desc=CIA Officers are trained to pick locks in almost complete silence, but this takes time - so take this automated pick with you and cut to the chase.\n\nGuaranteed to unlock most doors in 4 seconds or less!
@utility_dynamic_hammer_name=Dynamic Hammer
@utility_dynamic_hammer_desc=\n       "He held up his hammer high\n       And called to Odin for a sign"\n\nYour old Pa might have seemed a bit lame when fistpumping to heroic heavy metal on his commute, but there's something to be said about going into battle wielding a large hammer - even a space age one.\n\nUse it to smash open locked doors in one hit. No, you can't melee people with it.
@utility_bolt_cutter_name=Bolt Cutter
@utility_bolt_cutter_desc=<OLD!>The Bolt Cutter allows you to quickly cut\ndown padlocks and open fence gates.\n\nA must have tool in your inventory once you\nleave downtown and head to the real world.
@utility_breaching_kit_name=Breaching Kit
@utility_breaching_kit_desc=Sure, why not give both the Dynamic Hammer and the Bolt Cutter to the same guy.\n\nYou know which guy, right? We all know him, and he surely deserves it.
@equipment_protect0=Long Careers
@equipment_protect1=Handguns, SMGs
@equipment_protect2=Handguns, SMGs, Rifles

@disguise_poncho_name=Poncho
@disguise_poncho_desc=Become The Man with No Name, or better, No Guns - by draping a blanket over your shoulders. It's warm and stylish, and it supports the local economy - as maybe you won't need to drop bombs all over the place.\n\nHides your weapons so you can move unseen and adds 5 to Concealment, but once you reveal yourself, you can't go back.

@support_gear_housekeys=House Keys

# Pistols
@firearm_tt_33_name=TT-33 (7.62mmP / 8 rds)

@firearm_mps45sup_name=M&P 45C Suppressed


@firearm_ppk_name=PPK Pistol
@firearm_ppk_desc=The classic Bond pistol, the PPK is often carried by agents as it conceals very well. The short front makes it very easy to draw from a holster, but practical accuracy at medium range is sub-optimal.\n\nThe mag packs just 6 rounds of the not-so-hot .380 ACP, and slide-lock reloads are slow, so John-Wick this not.
@firearm_ppksup_name=PPK Suppressed
@firearm_ppksup_desc=Internal threading helps the PPK remain short even with a suppressor attached, and the .380 round is naturally silent. A good choice for stealth missions, but use suprise to maximize your Kill Probability, as the rounds you pack are not that deadly.\n\nSound Travel Range: 3.5m


@firearm_g19_name=G19 Pistol
@firearm_g19_desc=The compact G19 was designed to be light and concealable, but still works well as a combat pistol.\n\nIt's fast on the draw and keeps the best bits of its larger brothers: points quickly at the target, shoots fast and controlable; Medium and long range accuracy suffer from trigger and sight radius issues, though.
@firearm_g19sup_name=G19 Suppressed
@firearm_g19hp_desc=The compact G19 is light and concealable, but works as a combat pistol too. It keeps the best bits of its larger brothers: points quickly at the target and delivers rapid fire.\n\nThe CIA adds suppressor ready sights and barrel threading, losing just a tiny bit of draw speed. Bonus - increased long range accuracy.
@firearm_g19hpsup_desc=Mount a short suppressor to your G19. Its not the quietest 9mm out there, but it makes up for it by great maneuverability, and it works well enough to keep the enemy confused, if not oblivious.\n\nUse subsonic rounds for extra stealth effect.\n\nSound Travel Range: 7.5m
@firearm_g19cust_name=G19 Customized
@firearm_g19cust_desc=Take the simple, compact and popular G19, add +5 mag extensions, better sights and trigger, a match barrel with recoil compensator and mill the slide for optics.\n\nIt's a gunfighter's pistol, for sure, with good accuracy, minimal recoil, modern sighting options and no crap that you don't need.
@firearm_g19x_name=G19X Pistol
@firearm_g19x_desc=An inventory leftover from Army's service pistol trials, this is the original Austrian crossover: a fullsize 9mm frame mated with the slide and barrel of its compact brother.\n\nQuick on the draw and light on the hip, the G19X doesn't sacrifice on magazine capacity and shootability, but the average trigger hinders long range accuracy.
@firearm_g17_name=G17 Pistol
@firearm_g17_desc=The original, trend-setter polymer handgun, still keeping up and winning fights.\n\nThe pistol sits very low in the hand and points naturally, which means it gets fast on the target and stays there as you multi-tap it - provided you can master the heavy factory trigger.
@firearm_g2240_name=G22 Pistol
@firearm_g2240_desc=Somewhere, somehow, some pistol-toting secret squirrel decided that 9mm ammo lacks stopping power but .45 kicks too hard.\n\nThe G22 finds a happy middle-ground in the .40 S&W cartridge - without losing too much in mag capacity. A great close and mid-range pistol, but long range accuracy is a bit wonky.
@firearm_m17_name=M17 Pistol
@firearm_m17_desc=The Army's newest service pistol, this fullsize nine mil shoots accurately and sports great controls, which make coming up on target, mag reloads and general operation very quick and precise.\n\nIt suffers, however, from a bit of slowness when aiming at long range, due to its fat iron sights.
@firearm_m18_name=M18 Pistol
@firearm_m18_desc=The compact-ish version of the M17, it carries the same amount ammo and shoots about the same, just trades a bit of medium range accuracy for drawing speed and pointing speed.\n\nIf you're only looking for a backup for when the primary goes click instead of bang, this is your huckleberry.
@firearm_m9_name=M9 Pistol
@firearm_m9_desc=One of the original Wonder Nine that pushed 9mm Autos into world dominance, the M9 soldiers on doggedly - and you surely can't go wrong with John McClane's trusty pistol, right?\n\nThe M9 will serve well as backup and close range weapon, and even has the accuracy to pull off decent long range shots.
@firearm_m9sup_name=M9 Suppressed
@firearm_m9sup_desc=Sure, heavy firepower is great, but have you tried silent takedowns with your 7.62 beltfed? A suppressed secondary goes a long way in keeping insertion discrete.\n\nYour M9 can take a can with little work, but the sights are too low so you lose aimed fire.\n\nSound Travel Range: 7m

@firearm_1911_pistol_desc=Looking for a backup gun that ends fights on the spot? Pull the right strings at regiment level and smuggle in some forgotten crates of Browning's finest.\n\nThe sights may be crap and magazine size is small, but there's nothing like the fat .45 ACP slug to floor Tangos when your life depends on it.
@firearm_1911modern_pistol_desc=This is not your daddy's heirloom nor Army contraband, but a custom 1911 lovingly handfitted by ex-Unit armorers.\n\nThe high level of precision and the great single-action trigger make it a tack-driver - a large and heavy one though. Factor in the fat slugs it slings out at baddies and you kinda keep coming back to it.

@firearm_hk45ct_pistol_desc=The latest .45 the Frogmen adopted but don't carry around, the Mk24 gives you great accuracy and stopping power.\n\nThe high bore-axis makes rapid fire suboptimal, and 1st shot accuracy is hampered by the long Double Action trigger pull. But put a can on it and the gun truly shines, and clears the way for you.
@firearm_hk45ctSup_pistol_desc=Fat and slow .45 slugs are ideal to suppress, as there's no supersonic crack to alert the enemy, and the first shot often does the job.\n\nSuppressor's weight helps with muzzle flip, so practical rate of fire at short and medium ranges is improved.\n\nSound Travel Range: 5.5m

@firearm_hs45_pistol_desc=One of the less logical acquisitions on Nowheraki Forces supply chain, the HS-45 is accurate and gives you 13 fat .45 slugs to nail bad guys with.\n\nTrouble is, the ammo is very scarce, so your training level and practical rate of fire suffer as a result.

@firearm_mkl8_desc=The shorty Mk18 started out as a Navy SEALs custom carbine for pure CQB and vehicle work, but it quickly found its way into the lockers of cool Army teams.\n\nHandles doorways and short rooms very well, but the low muzzle velocity means it will not reliably drop targets past 15m.
@firearm_mk18Sup_desc=Suppressors reduce muzzle flash and sound report of firearms, and confuse unalerted enemies that do hear something.\n\nThere's no subsonic 5.56 ammo that can cycle the action, so this isn't that silent - but the added weight helps with recoil.\n\nSound Travel Range: 45m

@firearm_m4urgi_desc=The latest 556 carbine to be issued in quantity, the URG-I sports a full length, slim and light rail that improves recoil control, maneuverability and engagement speed.\n\nThe cyclic rate of fire is lower than the old M4s and reload speed is marginally worse, but for fast fire at medium range, this is competition level performance.

@firearm_m500pp_desc=Nowherakis don't normally use shotguns in combat operations, but they got some from the Marine units rotating out of the theatre.\n\nThe M500 is handy and packs a punch at point blank range, but you lack the ammo supply for door breaching and long range slug shooting.
@firearm_m1014_name=M1014 Shotgun
@firearm_m1014_desc=Combat shotguns are not regular Rangers weaponry these days, but there are some left in the Armory.\n\nThe M1014 is a reliable semi-auto death machine when firing buckshot, but won't cycle properly with breaching rounds and is too long for room clearing operations.
@firearm_breacher_name=Breacher Shotgun
@firearm_breacher_desc=A short and handy pistol-gripped shottie, loaded exclusively with breaching rounds.\n\nThese are specially designed to maximize effect on the locks while minimizing chances of ricochets and collateral damage.\n\nNo bad guy tapping with this one, sadly.
@firearm_shotguntango_name=Cruiser Shotgun (12GA / 5 rds)
@firearm_huntingshotgun_name=Side-by-side (12GA / 2 rds)
@firearm_sawnoff_name=Sawed-off Shotgun
@firearm_sawnoff_desc=A market-bought side-by-side shotgun that you cut down for concealment.\n\nYou point, not aim, with this boomstick and the spread gets a bit wild with distance, so don't count on it for anything else than close range work.\n\nAnd remember - two shots and you're out.\n\n
@firearm_cruisershottie_name=Cruiser Shotgun
@firearm_cruisershottie_desc=
@firearm_breacherCIA_name=Breacher Shotgun
@firearm_breacherCIA_desc=A short and handy pistol-gripped shottie, loaded exclusively with breaching rounds.\n\nThese are specially designed to maximize effect on the locks while minimizing chances of ricochets and collateral damage.\n\nNo bad guy tapping with this one, sadly.


# Enemy weapons
@firearm_rpk74lmg_name=RPK-74 LMG (5.45mm / 45 rds)
@firearm_rpk74lmg_desc=
@firearm_rpk16slmg_name=RPK-16 LMG (5.45mm / 95 rds)
@firearm_rpk16slmg_desc=
@firearm_rpklmg_name=RPK LMG (7.62mm / 75 rds)
@firearm_rpknws_name=RPK LMG
@firearm_rpknws_desc=The long-barreled LMG version of the AKM, gives you accuracy at range and the ability to put suppressing fire on the enemy - all without much weight penalty.\n\nLight as it is, the RPK is too long for CQB, so keep it in the back and place it in cover to get stabilization bonus. And do remember the reduced mag size!
@firearm_rp46mg_name=RP46 LMG (7.62mmR / 200 rds)
@firearm_rp46mg_desc=
@firearm_pkpmg_name=PKP LMG (7.62mmR / 100 rds)
@firearm_pkpmgcia_name=PKP Pecheneg LMG
@firearm_pkpmg_desc=The Spetsnaz-spec version of russian PKM, the Pecheneg is light for what it does and shoots an old school, full power 7.62 round.\n\nThe rounds hit hard and far, and easily suppress an area when needed.\n\nJust remember to use cover as support to increase stability.

@firearm_pm63_name=PM-63 (9mm / 25 rds)
@firearm_pm63cia_name=PM-63 RAK PDW
@firearm_pm63cia_desc=An old Personal Defense Weapon for Warsaw Pact crews and drivers, the PM-63 is readily available on the black market and looks mostly like an ordinary pistol.\n\nThe gun is strictly a close range tool as accuracy is bad and the sights recoil with the slide as you shoot, but for pocketable full auto mayhem, its rather unique.
@firearm_miniuzi_name=Mini Uzi (9mm / 32 rds)
@firearm_miniuzitango_name=Mini Uzi Supp. (9mm / 32 rds)
@firearm_apc9Ksupp_name=APC9K Supp. / Dot (9mm / 20 rds)
@firearm_miniuzicia_name=Mini Uzi SMG
@firearm_miniuzicia_desc=Popular with types that need both discretion and automatic firepower, the Mini Uzi is a bit outdated now in its heavy, all-steel construction and the open-bolt design limits single shot accuracy.\n\nIt shines in CQB work though, as the weight balances on top of the user's hand, reloads are fast and full-auto is very manageable.
@firearm_miniuzinws_desc=The stockless Mini Uzi sacrifices instant Kill Probability and recoil control to gain maneuverability and allow for one handed operation - with a shield.\n\nIt won't win any Limited Ammo Cups for sure, but as a pistol alternative that can literally spray and pray, it does have some merit.
@firearm_m4tango_name=M4 / 4x (5.56mm / 30 rds)
@firearm_type56_name=AK-47S (7.62mm / 30 rds)
@firearm_akm_name=AKM (7.62mm / 30 rds)
@firearm_akmkobra_name=AKM / Red Dot (7.62mm / 30 rds)
@firearm_type56cia_name=AK-47 Underfolder
@firearm_type56cia_desc=The underfolding stock version of the AK47 is easier to conceal, but its accuracy potential is hampered by the poor cheekweld.\n\nThe stock prevents the mounting of optics, but for surprise close range automatic firepower, this one is hard to beat.
@firearm_type56nws_desc=The underfolding stock version of the AK47 is slightly lighter, but its accuracy potential is hampered by the poor cheekweld.\n\nThe stock prevents the mounting of optics, but when close combat to the death is concerned, it won't make much of a difference.
@firearm_akmcia_name=AKM Rifle
@firearm_akmcia_desc=The standard insurgent combat rifle all around the world, it keeps working no matter what you do to it.\n\nIt's not particulary accurate nor fast at long range and reloads are relatively slow, but it does the most important thing - looks like it belongs in the busy streets of Nowheraki.
@firearm_akmnws_desc=Your combat rifle for a couple of years now, the AKM is what you know and trust best.\n\nThe fixed stock provides a decent cheekweld and allows precise fire out to medium range, but the sights are not very fast and reloads are slow.\n\nAlso, it's a bit on the heavy side.
@firearm_akm_gl_name=AKM/GP34 GL
@firearm_akm_gl_desc=The tried and true AKM but with an underbarrel grenade launcher, this is your main tool to lead the team and apply heavy firepower where needed.\n\nThe 40mm grenades are good to flush people out of cover, even though your Soviet-designed grenades carry less charge than the US ones.
@firearm_aks74u_name=AKS-74U (5.45mm / 30 rds)
@firearm_aks74uemir_name=AKS-74U (5.45mm / 45 rds)
@firearm_aks74ucia_name=AKS-74U Carbine
@firearm_aks74uciaSup_name=AKS-74U Suppressed
@firearm_aks74ucia_desc=Designed as a PDW for too-cool Soviet forces and used as status symbol all through the Middle East, the AKSU is a handy little beast of an Assault Rifle.\n\nIt's balanced perfectly for close range and CQB work, but the short barrel and sight radius sacrifice long range accuracy and stopping power.
@firearm_aks74uciaSup_desc=You can't really silence a 5.45mm carbine unless you source unobtanium subsonic ammo, but the suppressor helps to confuse the enemy, hide your flash signature and control recoil in rapid fire situations.
@firearm_arm14_name=AK-47M SF Carbine
@firearm_arm14_desc=An AKS-U copy built to accomodate your 7.62x39 supply chain, the Special Forces carbine is well suited for fast movement and Close Quarters Battle.\n\nThe short barrel and sight radius sacrifice long range accuracy, so equip combat optics to mix it up at distance.
@firearm_vulcan_name=Vulcan Rifle
@firearm_vulcanSup_name=Vulcan Suppressed
@firearm_vulcan_desc=Eastern European AK built in bullpup format, the Vulcan gives you ammo and magazine commonality with the rest of the force but shortens the length of the rifle to make it very handy for CQB work. As a bonus, you get to mount US-made optics!\n\nReloads are still messy and slow, so don't get caught with and empty mag.
@firearm_vulcanSup_desc=The Vulcan is still an AK, so you don't have any subsonic ammo available.\n\nThe good news is, even with the suppressor on, the Vulcan is short, handy, and great for Close Quarters Combat.
@firearm_ak105alpha_name=AK-105 Alpha (5.45mm / 30 rds)
@firearm_ak105tango_name=AK-105 / 1-6x (5.45mm / 30 rds)
@firearm_ak105alphacia_desc=Styled after the latest trends of RusSOF operators but upgraded in the good old USA, the Alpha keeps the AK internals and adds a collapsible stock and full rails to mount your capitalist optics.\n\nThe gun will anger purists and is heavy for a mid-length AK but shoots straight and provides deadly mid-range rapid fire.
@firearm_ak105alphaciaSup_desc=You can't really silence a 5.45mm carbine unless you source very rare subsonic ammo,but the suppressor helps to confuse the enemy and hide your flash signature. As for recoil control, the Alpha was front heavy to begin with, so this doesn't really help.
@firearm_ak105alphacia_name=AK-105 Alpha
@firearm_ak105alphaciaSup_name=AK-105 Suppressed
@firearm_sr3m_name=SR3-M (9mm AP / 20 rds)
@firearm_fal_name=FAL (7.62mm / 20 rds)
@firearm_falnws_name=FAL Rifle
@firearm_falnws_desc=
@firearm_falmil_desc=Dubbed The Right Arm of the Free World, the Belgian FAL is widespread as a black market weapon but takes skill to use properly.\n\nThe rifle hits hard and far and serves as a wannabe DMR for Militia types, but you lack the ammo or optics to make it truly effective at range.
@firearm_smlemk3_name=SMLE Mk.III (.303 British / 10 rds)

@firearm_RPG7_name=RPG-7 (93mm HEAT)
@firearm_RPG7nws_name=RPG-7 Launcher
@firearm_RPG7nws_desc=RPG-7 Launcher
@firearm_RPG26_name=RPG-26 (72.5mm HEAT)
@firearm_RPG26cia_name=RPG-26 Launcher
@firearm_RPG26cia_desc=The one-shot RPG26 is lighter, smaller and less conspicious than your AT4 option, but also shoots a smaller and slower warhead.\n\nShould still do a good job as hole puncher in walls, doors and any unlucky enemy.\n\nAnd it does fit nicely with your local garb outfit.\n\nDeploy time: 3 seconds\nLethal Blast Range: 2m
@firearm_RPG26nws_desc=The one-shot RPG26 is your light and disposable rocket launcher, familiar to everyone since army days.\n\nShould do a good job as hole puncher in walls, doors and any unlucky enemy, and maybe the occasional mission objective.\n\nDeploy time: 2.5 seconds\nLethal Blast Range: 2m
@firearm_SVD_name=SVD-63 (7.62mmR / 10 rds)
@firearm_SVDcia_name=SVD-63 Dragunov
@firearm_SVDcia_desc=The Russian Army marksman rifle is not uncommon in these streets, so it should raise less eyebrows when you play local.\n\nIt's long, heavy but not unwieldy, and just accurate enough to score good hits at practical ranges - but the bullets hit hard and pierce through level III armor.
@firearm_SVDnws_desc=The Russian Army marksman rifle is your go-to precision tool, but most troopers don't have the knowhow to use it effectively.\n\nIt's long and shoots a powerful cartridge, so put in cover to stabilize it properly and your special training kicks in, extending its effective range to almost 50m.
@firearm_SVUnws_name=SVU-A Bullpup
@firearm_SVUnws_desc=A bullpup redesign of the SVD marksman rifle, the SVU is shorter and better suited for urban combat - but loses some long range accuracy due to shorter barrel.\n\nThis variant also adds automatic fire and sports a muzzle brake to help with recoil, but the limited magazine capacity makes it impractical for anything but emergency use.
@firearm_VSS_name=VSS (9mm AP Silent / 10 rds)
@firearm_VSScia_name=VSS Vintorez
@firearm_VSScia_desc=Built by the Soviets for clandestine ops, the VSS uses very heavy subsonic rifle ammo and an integral suppressor to provide silent marksman fire at medium range.\n\nAnd if there's unexpected trouble, it can rock-n-roll on Full Auto, too!\n\nSound Travel Range: 3.5m

@mountedweap_dshk_name=DShK (12.7mm AP / 50 rds)

@firearm_mac_10_smg_name=Mac-10 SMG (Auto / 9mm)
@firearm_mac_10_smg_desc=
@firearm_mp5k_pdw_name=MP5K PDW (Auto / 9mm)
@firearm_evo_3_smg_name=Evo 3 SMG
@firearm_evo_3_smg_desc=<OLD!>Europeans love their SMGs and the rapid-\nfiring, compact Evo 3 is a great example.\n\nFast on the target and quick to fill it with\n9mm holes, it mixes European and American-\nstyle controls intelligently and can be\nrun and reloaded very efficiently.\n\nOverall one hell of a bang for your buck.
@firearm_bren_a1_assault_rifle_name=Bren A1 Assault Rifle
@firearm_bren_a1_assault_rifle_desc=<OLD!>A newcomer polymer assault rifle from\nCentral Europe, the Bren will do the job\nbut not break the bank.\n\nBetter than average long range accuracy is\nowed to the modular stock, but controls and\noverall layout make the Bren relatively\nslow in practical operation.
@firearm_ump45_smg_name=UMP45 SMG
@firearm_ump45_smg_desc=<OLD!>The UMP fires the reliable .45 ACP and does\nit with German accuracy, providing the\nhighest stopping power you can get in a\nSMG package.\n\nA bit large and unwieldy for most users,\nand the heavy recoil affects follow-up\nshots speed and accuracy.
@firearm_mp5a3_sd_smg_name=Mp5A3-SD SMG
@firearm_mp5a3_sd_smg_desc=<OLD!>Mounting a 7 inch suppressor on your Mp5A3\nmight not be the best way to maintain CQB\nmaneuverability, but will lower shot sound\nlevels by a decent number of decibels.\n\nThe weapon loses some accuracy but in\npractical terms effects are negligible.\n\nSound Travel Range: 10m
@firearm_ump45_sd_smg_name=UMP45-SD SMG
@firearm_ump45_sd_smg_desc=<OLD!>Mounting a suppressor on the UMP45 is\nstraightforward and efficient, as long as\nyou accept handling a 16 inch barrel SMG.\n\nVery deadly at close range and against bad\nguys not wearing armor.\n\nSound Travel Range: 5m
@firearm_mp7sd_smg_name=MP7-SD SMG
@firearm_mp7sd_smg_desc=<OLD!>The small and maneuverable Mp7 shoots tiny\nbullets, but the low recoil and flat, rifle-\nlike trajectory translate into quick and\naccurate bursts of fire even at long range.\n\nThose tiny bullets do punch through kevlar\nwith ease, even when suppressed.\n\nSound Travel Range: 4m
@firearm_m4_cqbr_name=M4 CQB-R (Auto / 5.56mm)
@firearm_mpx_40_smg_name=MPX .40 SMG
@firearm_mpx_40_smg_desc=<OLD!>A modern submachinegun with AR15-style\ncontrols, the MPX is fast in operation and\nvery maneuverable in close spaces.\n\nHigh Rate of Fire coupled with decent\nstopping power make this a reliable fight\nstopper until the bad guys start donning\nbody armor.
@firearm_p90_pdw_name=P90 PDW
@firearm_p90_pdw_desc=<OLD!>A compact Personal Defense Weapon shooting\na high velocity intermediate round, the P90\nis great for Close Quarters Combat and will\npierce straight through level IIIA armor.\n\nThe flat trajectory of the 5.7mm is great\nfor mid-to-long range shots, but stopping\npower potential is less than that of SMGs\nshooting traditional calibers.
@firearm_g36c_assault_rifle_name=G36C Assault Rifle
@firearm_g36c_assault_rifle_desc=<OLD!>A favorite of European SWAT teams, the G36C\nis short, light and very maneuverable.\n\nThe short barrel comes at the expense of\nstopping power though, as the low muzzle\nvelocity cuts under the reliable frag-\nmentation threshold for 5.56 rounds.
@firearm_mk16_pdw_name=Mk 16 PDW
@firearm_mk16_pdw_desc=<OLD!>This ultra compact PDW is handy in close\nquarters or when concealment is needed.\n\nIts small size makes it quick to get into\naction but the skeleton stock is a poor\nshooting platform, so accuracy and recoil\ncontrol are sub-standard.\n\nNot recommended for hostage rescue work.
@firearm_hk416d10_name=HK416D10 Carbine
@firearm_hk416d10_desc=<OLD!>The German engineering take on the AR15,\nthe HK416 is a favorite of Tier 1 Special\nOperation Groups and armchair commandos\nworldwide.\n\nVery reliable and accurate, in the 10 inch\nbarrel version it's also maneuverable but\na little slow on the target due to the heavy\nrail.
@firearm_commando_553_name=Commando 553
@firearm_commando_553_desc=<OLD!>Another European carbine built to very\nhigh standards, the 553 is accurate and\nmaneuverable, but falls behind on stopping\npower due to the short barrel.\n\nGood balance makes it easy to reload and\nrecover from dropping the barrel in a tight\nspot.
@firearm_vector_smg_name=Vector SMG
@firearm_vector_smg_desc=<OLD!>The avant-garde Vector SMG masters the\npowerful .45 rounds by clever positioning\nof shooter hands and directing the bolt to\nrecoil downards.\n\nResulting recoil is very mild and allows\nimpressive 2 round bursts grouping, but the\nshort barrel makes for less spectacular\nfirst round accuracy.
@firearm_sar18_bullpup_name=SAR-18 Bullpup
@firearm_sar18_bullpup_desc=<OLD!>With an 18 inch barrel and an overall length\nof 27.5, the SAR is a great mix of accuracy,\nstopping power and maneuverabilty.\n\nThe placement of the magazine well to the\nrear slows down reloads considerably,\nthough, and weight is a bit on the high side.
@firearm_ak47_rifle_name=AK-47 Rifle (Semi / 7.62mm)
@firearm_ak47_drum_name=AK-47 Drum (Auto / 7.62mm)
@firearm_sniper_rifle_name=SniperRifle
@firearm_p90sd_pdw_name=P90-SD PDW
@firearm_p90sd_pdw_desc=<OLD!>The P90 is a great submachinegun for most\nurban engagements, but suppressing it does\nnot cover the supersonic crack of its high\nvelocity rounds.\n\nUsing subsonic ammo would negate the issue,\nbut would also lose most platform traits.\n\nSound Travel Range: 10m
@firearm_mpxsd_40_smg_name=MPX-SD .40 SMG
@firearm_mpxsd_40_smg_desc=<OLD!>The integrally suppressed version of the\nMPX is a joy to operate in combat thanks to \nthe AR-15 style controls.\n\nSubsonic .40 rounds don't pack that much of\na punch, but with the right training will\nmake short work of bad guy groups.\n\nSound Travel Range: 3m
@firearm_vectorsd_smg_name=Vector-SD SMG
@firearm_vectorsd_smg_desc=<OLD!>Suppressing .45 SMGs is a no-brainer and\nthe Vector's can has excellent signature\nreduction and zero effect on accuracy.\n\nYou'll appreciate the deadly bursts on\ntargets at close to medium range, but watch\nout for armored bad guys.\n\nSound Travel Range: 4m
@firearm_hk416d10sd_carabine_name=HK416D10-SD Carbine
@firearm_hk416d10sd_carabine_desc=<OLD!>Attaching a suppressor to a Short Barrel\nRifle is not optimal but does reduce the\nsound signature a little bit while keeping\nthe long range accuracy and lethality.\n\nYou best keep the increased barrel length\nin mind when navigating interior spaces.\n\nSound Travel Range: 13m
@firearm_honey_badger_name=Honey Badger
@firearm_honey_badger_desc=<OLD!>A great mix of ballistic performance, small\nsize and excellent sound suppression, the\nHoney Badger might gain a permanent spot in\nthe hands of Tier 1 Special Forces.\n\nArmor penetration is not great though, only\nmarginally better than pistol-caliber SMGs.\n\nSound Travel Range: 3.5m
@firearm_fal_mini_osw_name=FAL Mini OSW (Auto / 7.62mm)
@firearm_mp9_smg_name=MP9 SMG (Auto / 6.5mm AP)
@firearm_x635_pdw_name=X635 PDW
@firearm_x635_pdw_desc=<OLD!>A PDW boasting carbine-like ballistics,\nthe X635 shoots a 6mm cartridge designed to\nperform best out of short barrels and\nhalve recoil compared to classic M4s.\n\nShort enough to go through doorframes with\nlittle fuss, this classic styled PDW keeps\nlong range accuracy with no practical loss\nin stopping power.
@firearm_mcx300_carbine_name=MCX 300 Carbine
@firearm_mcx300_carbine_desc=<OLD!>Mixing AR-like controls with folding stock\ncompatible internals and designed for the\npowerful 300 Blackout cartridge, the MCX\nhandles right for close quarter ops and\ntakes down targets reliably.\n\nA great performer up to medium range, but\nloses aiming speed as you go farther.

# Shotfuns
@firearm_breacher_shotgun_name=Breacher Shotgun
@firearm_breacher_shotgun_desc=<OLD!>The shortest pump shotgun available to you,\nit's quick to get into action and quick to\nsetup for door breaching.\n\nThe short length comes at a price though,\nas the magazine barely tackles one lock\nbefore running out of ammo.\n\n
@firearm_m870_room_clearer_name=M870 Room Clearer
@firearm_m870_room_clearer_desc=<OLD!>Sized just right for prolonged indoor\nadventures, the Room Cleaner comes with a\nhealthy magazine capacity and allows side-\nstepping through a door opening in ready\nposition.\n\nShot dispersion is still an issue so take\nextra care around hostages and fellow\nofficers.
@firearm_m590_shotgun_name=M590 Shotgun
@firearm_m590_shotgun_desc=<OLD!>The standard and dependable pump-action\nshotgun in Police inventory, the M590 comes\nwith great mag capacity but suffers in CQB\nspaces due to the long and unwieldy barrel.\n\nAs with all shotguns, keep in mind shot\ndispersion and target background.
@firearm_joint_combat_shotgun_name=Joint Combat Shotgun
@firearm_joint_combat_shotgun_desc=<OLD!>A Semi-Automatic shotgun in the familiar\ntube-fed design, the JCS is fun to shoot and\ngreat for pure short range firepower.\n\nNot the shortest boomstick around, though,\nso you'll need to support the breacher with\nanother trooper. Also, the mag goes empty\nfaster than you'd think.
@firearm_m26_lss_name=M26 LSS
@firearm_m26_lss_desc=<OLD!>Straight from the inventory of US Special\nForces, a magazine fed, bolt action shotgun.\n\nSurprisingly easy to charge but a little\nunwieldy in room clearing due to the awk-\nward hand positioning on the operating bolt,\nthe M26 is still a solid performer at close\nrange.
@firearm_sawnoff_shotgun_name=Sawn-Off Shotgun (12 Ga)
@firearm_ksg_shotgun_name=KSG Shotgun
@firearm_ksg_shotgun_desc=<OLD!>A very avant-garde design for a pump-action\nshotgun, the KSG uses twin tubular magazines\nto hold a whooping 14 shells.\n\nThe bullpup form maximizes maneuverability\nand accuracy, at the expense of awkward\nreloads and access to the ejection port.\n\nCannot use Ejection Port Reload doctrine.
@firearm_six12_shotgun_name=Six 12 Shotgun
@firearm_six12_shotgun_desc=<OLD!>The Six 12 is really a large, double-action\nrevolver that fires shotgun shells.\n\nSimple and revolutionary at the same time,\nthe design makes for quick reloads as long\nas you can juggle with the cylinders.\n\nCannot use Ejection Port Reload doctrine.
