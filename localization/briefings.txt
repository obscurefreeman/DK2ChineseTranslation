# Mission Specific Briefings and Intel Info 
#
@briefing_pathtosuckless=A Rangers scouting party chanced upon a small Insurgent workshop, complete with distracted sentry outside and suspicious noises inside.\n\nClear the structure of all hostiles.\n\nLeft-click-drag on your troopers to plot their path through the building.\n\nTroopers will automatically engage enemies in their field-of-view.
@briefing_wooddoorsareeasy=SIGINT eavesdropping pinpoints a High Value Target in this apartment, with armed escort present.\n\nLocate, detain and evacuate the HVT.\n\nYou are outnumbered, so use flashbangs and Sniper Support on your initial breach, then proceed to search and clear step by step.\n\nExercise caution when employing explosives, as the precise location of the HVT is not known at this time. 
@briefing_alltogethernow=An isolated Insurgent element of strength 5 to 6 has been roughing up locals at a corner minimarket, and must be dealt with to conserve Hearts, Minds, and some really juicy watermelons.\n\nEliminate or detain all hostiles.\n\nThis is not a hostage situation as far as we know, but civilians are present and the store furniture creates a complex line of fire geometry. A multiple breach points entry is recommended, so use go codes to sync up. 
@intel_alltogethernow_weapons=Unarmed enemies may pick up weapons if given the chance. 
@intel_alltogethernow_windows=Blocked windows can be cleared by manual breaching or explosive charges. 

@briefing_whywefight=Time Sensitive Intel places a pair of hostages at this known insurgent hideout. Heavy enemy presence is expected, including Veteran fighters and S-vests.\n\nLocate and rescue all hostages.\n\nThis is a night mission, so use that to your advantage by cutting out the lights in the compound - but don't forget to equip NVGs!
@intel_whywefight_gratingdoor=Grating doors and chainlink fences do not block view and expose you to enemy observation and gunfire. 
@intel_whywefight_gate=Sheet Metal Gates are more difficult to breach via mechanical methods. Use explosives to gain entry fast. 
@briefing_rescueatdawn=Drone surveillance of a known Insurgent facility has spotted a hostage being smuggled in last night, possibly on the way to the border badlands. Our windfall is possibly just temporary engine trouble, so we must hit the location today.\n\nLocate and rescue the hostage.\n\nThe location is known to permanently host at least a dozen fighters, and more have arrived last night. Use surprise, speed, and localized extreme violence to gain the upper hand.
@briefing_jihadiliveshow=Our Jihadist neighbors are livestreaming an execution right now, but - fortunately - they are still monologueing about this or that. This won't last, so we need to act now.\n\nSave all hostages and neutralize all bad guys.\n\nThere's 3 hostages that need to be rescued, but we believe only one to be in the execution room - so explosive breaching may be conducted with minimal risk.\n\nKeep eyes open for the masked Executioner types - they will not hesitate to shoot the hostages if they spot you or your deadly handiwork. 
@briefing_killingtime=This is a simple Tier One hit on an overt enemy encampment - Get In and Take Down anyone that resists.\n\nClear the structure of all hostiles.\n\nWe know for sure there are no civilians, non-combatants or hostages present, and the enemies are mostly low level insurgents. Surprise is on your side - now add speed and solid teamwork. 

@briefing_gatecrashers=We're hitting an enemy staging house the Hollywood way - crashing the front door and jumping out guns blazing.\n\nClear the structure of all hostiles.\n\nThe enemy might have noticed your lousy parking skills, so the surprise advantage will wear out fast - but if you move quickly you'll still catch them with their pants down.\n\nYou can also use the rear gate approach, if your troopers pack gear light enough to jump some fences on the way to the deploy slots. 
@briefing_vbiedsareus=Insurgent cell chatter has peaked in the last few hours, leading us to this compound - which Intel suggests they are using to manufacture VBIEDs. They may be the source of attacks on civilians all across the region.\n\nRoll in violently and secure the location as fast as possible.\n\nYour driving has improved since last time, so they don’t know you’ll be coming. Capitalize on that surprise and hit them before they can dig in or set off any explosives. 
@briefing_aquaintlittleman=Site Exploitation of the VBIED factory revealed a surprising level of technical sophistication - with particular details pointing straight at a former professor at the Kharsheri Technical University.\n\nIncidentally, the professor left his job after encouraging his students to attack coalition forces, but otherwise kept to himself and his work.\n\nCapture the Professor.\n\nInitial surveillance shows your target's residence being guarded by two armed insurgents. Go slowly and carefully and make sure not to smoke our target in the process. 
@briefing_fireandmaneuver=In the east of the city, a recently discovered insurgent safehouse is being used as staging area as well as occasional holding facility for captives. Local assets of high confidence have identified a hostage on site, kept under guard in the shed to the rear of the safehouse.\n\nSecure and extract the hostage.\n\nThe enemy presence includes veterans and lower ranked grunts, but is concentrated in the main building. You can go in stealthily and sneak the hostage out, or you can launch a full-on assault to remind them why hostage taking isn’t profitable. 
@briefing_safehousestrike=A no kidding post it note found on the kitchen table of an earlier raid, has led us to a new hit right down the block. We'll drop by and help with the weapons shipment that needed unloading.\n\nEliminate all resistance at the depot.\n\nThis site will be better guarded than your usual targets, with more experienced opponents in prepared positions, so plan your initial breach carefully.\n\nThey say you should always know your target and what lies behind it, this does not apply to grenades, so use them to your heart’s content for clearing those tough angles and crannies.
@briefing_alhasanhasitall=Debrief on the shed rescue hostage has revealed a wealth of intel on how insurgents constantly move their captives around town so that they are harder to pinpoint.\n\nA network of locations is used, and we were able to identify the first of those as the warehouse of one Art Al-Hasan, importer. And exporter.\n\nEnter the warehouse and rescue any hostages.\n\nThis facility has it all - large open spaces, small rooms as well as multiple places for an insurgent to get the jump on you. Open spaces are horrible for moving through but great for killing, just be thorough in your clearing. 
@briefing_vipersnest=Another hostage debrief filled us in on a cell leader meeting that was being discussed by their captors. Turns out being an insurgent isn’t all fun and games, and some have to talk logistics and synch training calendars.\n\nLong story short we are now zeroed on this meeting - at a small home in the east of the city.\n\nEliminate all enemy forces on site.\n\nYour only avenue of approach is a potential bullet funnel, so move quickly or utilize smoke cover and superior fire to make entry on the structure.\n\nRemember, there are no good guys here, so you are weapons free. 
@briefing_truebelievers=Exploiting the electronics and pocket lint haul from an earlier raid, we've diverted a small squad to check a possible HVT ping.\n\nRaid the location, detain and evacuate the HVT.\n\nWe believe the enemy to be lacking in experience but well prepared and itching for a fight, so take it slowly and don't run to your death.\n\nAlso, watch out for possible squirters and backdoor escapees - there's no point in conquering an empty nest. 
@briefing_tuffnutcrackers=This is what it all comes down to - we got the regional commander's address corroborated from an insurgent’s phone and SIGINT tracing an ongoing broadcast to the same location.\n\nEliminate all resistance in the compound.\n\nThere is a lot of open ground and some heavily armed insurgents here, but you have resources to deploy a sizeable force.\n\nCapitalize on the multiple avenues of approach to divert insurgent fires and move through each building to ensure everyone who needs to be killed is. 

@briefing_trainingwheels=
@briefing_breakanddestroy=Our signals intelligence team has used cell phone intercepts of foreign advisor calls to locate their base of operations. Currently we have an enemy platoon sized element staged for a major operation located at this compound.\n\nDestroy all enemy munitions.\n\nOur main objective is not killing every enemy, rather it is to neutralize the tow launcher and missiles that the insurgents will use in their future operations. Stealth can be a valuable weapon for this mission, and utilizing undercover units to stealthily infiltrate the objective can greatly improve our odds of mission success. 
@briefing_snatchandgrab=Recent interrogations have revealed an HVT’s safehouse deep in the city. Currently there is a large insurgent force guarding him with a mounted gun and external patrols.\n\nInfiltrate the compound and capture the HVT.\n\nThere are a few ways to crack this egg. Remember, if the HVT hears you, he will attempt to flee down the eastern road. That being said, stealth or the rapid execution of violence are your two best options. Just remember that there is an insurgent quick reaction force to the north, so if you go in loud, be sure to have external security to help you push them back.  
@briefing_marketday=Our advance surveillance cell has confirmed the location of a long lost US national. We must strike and rescue him before the trail gets cold.\n\nRetrieve and rescue the hostage.\n\nYou are deep in enemy territory, with a small force and no backup. Enemy presence outnumbers you by far and civilian casualties are a concern.\n\nYou are advised to use concealment to approach the target and extract the package before the enemy reacts in force or executes the hostage. 
@briefing_deathdealers=A months-long effort in tracking missing ATGMs has brought\n"Fergie & The SAD Boys" in position to make a purchase - but we don't have the funds, nor do we have clearance to JDAM the whole lot. \nYou'll just have to go hands-on and disable the warheads yourself.\n\nSabotage or blow up all warheads.\n\nThe location is very hot, so stick to the plan and get out of there as soon as possible.

@briefing_foreigninfluencers=The "Forbidden Tree" - a particularly fanatical sect of Foreign Jihadis - are making a move on Capital City proper, looking to establish presence and shake down businesses. We should drop in too and say Hi!\n\nEliminate all enemies in the area.\n\nMost of these guys are pretty deadly shots but will also blow themselves up rather than be taken alive, so keep your distance and watch for S-Vests.\n\nThe mission allows forward deployment for undercover units, but there's also an alternate deployment via the sewers - if you rank up the unit mobility. 
@briefing_universityassault=A week ago, the F-Tree wackos have taken over an University building, and now they've decided to move from book burning to throat slicing - which means we need to go in right now.\n\nLocate and rescue all hostages.\n\nThere are 5 hostages to save, but only one is currently visible - soon to be dead.\n\nThe school yard is visibly fortified and tough to crack, but we expect heavier defenses in the building. Look out for IEDs, S-vests and a will to fight to the death. 
@briefing_canyonambush=Misplaced trust and treachery have landed one of our squads at the wrong end of an ambush, surrounded and outgunned.\n\nSurvive and eliminate all enemies.\n\nYour forces merged into a mixed force of Allied Militia, but their allegiance is currently unclear.\n\nExpect to be engaged from the lead and trail vehicles, but beware of the Heavy Machineguns dominating the checkpoint.
@briefing_preciouscargo=The enemy has conquered our lands, taken over our homes and enslaved our families. We have a small SWAT element infiltrated in enemy-held territory, in position to recover some family members from enemy captivity.\n\nSecure and Evac both Females.\n\nThe enemy is all around us, so expect reinforcements to arrive if the alarm is raised. Those present on location will not go out without a fight, and they will rather kill than surrender our people. 

@briefing_noisyneighbors=In this neighborhood, people know the difference between a stereo bass and the sound of a light machine gun going into battery. Locals are telling us that a large group of insurgents moved in and they aren’t turning their music down.\n\nClear the apartment of all hostiles.\n\nThere are a lot of complicated angles and open spaces in this apartment. Remember, you have the rest of your life to die. So take it slow and use as many munitions to tip the scales in your favor as you like. 
@briefing_theview=48 hours ago, 3 American journalists were taken hostage by insurgents. We were able to locate them after one of the hostage takers took a selfie of himself with the hostages and the scenic view of their hideout.\n\nBreach the apartment and secure the hostages.\n\nThe insurgents are ready to execute the prisoners at a moment’s notice, so speed and silence are encouraged options. Whatever option you make, give these journalists some good material for their memoirs. 
@briefing_ratwork=Insurgents are staged to execute 3 hostages on a balcony overlooking the Nowehraki National Police headquarters. They are not anticipating a fight, but are highly numbered and heavily armed. We can only spare two of your operators to make entry on the structure.\n\nMake entry, and rescue the hostages.\n\nYou have access to the sniper who has been feeding us intel as the situation developed. He reports that the enemy’s disposition appears relaxed and unalert. Capitalize on this, but keep in mind the large number of insurgents present.
@briefing_uninvitedguests=A local insurgent cell dragged off an outspoken critic of their “cause” last night and have taken him to a home in the heart of the city. Our signals intelligence analysts intercepted a call from the cell leader to the regional warlord looking to sell their hostage.\n\nRescue the hostage and eliminate any enemy personnel as you deem fit.\n\nSurprise is on your side here, but numbers are not. Multiple doors, long lines of sight, short rooms, and a possible suicide bomber will all present numerous angles and surprises for you and the enemy. We were able to run a rappel lane, but whoever goes will need to be fast.
@briefing_door2door=The personal driver of the local Al-Urzeri cell leader just walked into our office this morning to give us the location of his boss. His reason? Well, he was tired of only working for “the good of the cause”. The good news for him is that his tip will land him $50K USD if it’s accurate.\n\nClear the target building and capture the HVT before he can escape.\n\nOur informant tipped us off that a large meeting is taking place at the target house. So be ready for a fight to get this guy.
@briefing_roomservice=At one point in time this was one of the most sought-after resorts in the eastern hemisphere. The war has changed all that. Now it is only a place of refuge for foreign press and diplomatic visitors. Which is exactly what brings us here. This morning two cells of insurgents stormed the 8th floor and seized three rooms used by European reporters.\n\nRescue the hostages post haste.\n\nAn insurgent wearing a suicide vest was observed in the raiding party so keep an eye out. You have a sniper with eyes on target who has noted that the enemy seems currently unaware of our rescue. Use that to your advantage. 
@briefing_pincerspower=Two very unlucky aid workers got snatched last night while on their nightly jog. Their trail has led us here.\n\nBreach the building and rescue the hostages.\n\nThis will be a tough one. Although small, this house has many enemies behind tight corners. Getting a shot on these guys won’t just be a matter of angles, but speed and surprise as well. The insurgents guarding these guys are hardened fighters, and they will give you a run for your money if you let them. So be sure to plan adequately and fully commit to your plan of action.
@briefing_lonelyabode=This little house was once a home full of life. As the war raged on it’s little family was forced to leave for safety across the border. Now it’s a husk of a home full of angry men who’ve forgotten where they once grew up as well.\n\nMake entry and neutralize all enemies or rescue the hostages.\n\nThe long hallways and weary occupants make this house an assaulter’s dream. So, capitalize on the angles and clear lines of sight to dominate the enemy and seize the house. Speed and surprise are your weapons, and the guys behind those doors have no idea what’s coming for them.
@briefing_bigboomcondo=The clock is ticking, and there’s only enough spare time for one more breath. This flat is full of die-hard jihadists ready to drop an entire apartment complex at a moment’s notice, and that moment is now.\n\nBreach the condo and disable all explosives.\n\nOur sniper has a view on the flat but can only do so much from his position. Speed and violence are the only options on this one. You ready? Take a breath, and go to work. 

@briefing_hotroom=Insurgents have stormed City Hall and taken the mayor hostage in his office. We have a team providing an observation post for us in the apartment across the street. From their position, it looks as though the insurgents plan on executing him, but we are not aware of when this will happen.\n\nBreach the office and rescue the hostage.\n\nThe insurgents in the office are on their toes and ready to kill at the slightest sound. Silence or speed are your best options here, but mind your security all through the premises. 
@briefing_knivesinthedark=Jihadis have taken refuge in a safehouse within the city after their recent defeat. We believe that this cell will launch a counteroffensive from this location to reseize territory. That cannot happen.\n\nBreach their defenses and kill all hostile occupants.\n\nWe have not found evidence of any civilians in the area, so, you are free to proceed however you deem fit.\n\nThey don’t know you are coming yet, so you’ll have surprise on your side - use it and use the darkness to your advantage.\n\nNeutralizing this cell will destabilize their entire offensive, so it is critical that all hostiles are eliminated.
@briefing_techsupport=Neighbors in a high-rise apartment complex informed our HUMINT collectors of suspects carrying heavy equipment and what looked like at least one suicide vest. We have several potential targets to visit, so small teams are hitting them all simultaneously.\n\nEnter the apartment and neutralize their equipment.\n\nWe believe they could be placing MANPADS or ATGM for an attack on Coalition Forces, so you'll be saving lives.\n\nGood luck, and stay vigilant for that s-vest.
@briefing_traphouse=Something is bumping behind those doors and it sure isn’t music. Jihadis have kidnapped a European aid worker and are holding him at this house. Be aware, we have reputable intelligence telling us that this is a ploy to kill coalition forces, and the entire house is wired to blow.\n\nEnter the house and secure the hostage\n\nThis mission is incredibly dangerous, but if we don’t do this, a good man will die. You don’t have much time and there are many enemies looking to become martyrs behind those doors. Move quickly and deliberately to secure the hostage and neutralize the bombs before they can level this block. 
@briefing_scratchedcarpets=Rescue mission for one of our inTERPreter's family tonight - a Jihadist group is looking to off their heads on live TV. \n\nSave all hostages and neutralize all bad guys.\n\nThis is an In-Extremis assault, with too few troops deployed for a too tough rescue - we just can't wait for more.\n\nWe know where 2 of the hostages currently are, but a 3rd one should be taken into account. All of them must live. 
@briefing_flatmates=Your Agency Safe House is compromised and the enemy is seconds away from kicking down the front door.\n\nExtract the VIP safely.\n\nThere's no telling how many Jihadis are coming, probably more than your ammo supply.\n\nFortify to repel the first assault, but don't linger in the area too much - the odds are not in your favor.
@briefing_islandcafe=We've hitched a ride on a Navy Riverine Craft to hit an Insurgent meeting taking place at King's Checkers - a secluded island Cafe.\n\nThey probably think rocks and water keep them safe, but they'll learn wet feet don't scare our boys.\n\nSecure and extract the two HVTs.\n\nThe Cafe is a small structure with both outdoor and indoor spaces - and we believe our targets are conferencing behind locked doors.\n\nThe targets brought their own security to the location, and more is on standby as QRF. Plan accordingly, and don't let them escape. 
@briefing_fuelstop=Insurgents are stirring trouble by blowing up another sect's home turf - and civilians get caught in the crossfire. This time its a fuel station, so if it goes up in flames the neverending chain of retribution will go up two notches.\n\nDisarm all explosives and neutralize the insurgents.\n\nWe got word of this hit just in time, but only a small cell is in position to respond. Make the best use of an imperfect situation and clear fast on your way to the bombs.\n\nLook for the explosives in the store-room and the station yard - these guys are known to spice up their IEDs with motor oil and gas tanks. 
@briefing_theritual=There were rumors of a new Cult Leader performing unspoken acts on animals and people alike; common wisdom put it out as rural legend. Turns out he's real, and locals are fed up with him and ratted him out to us. We need to go in and stop his latest unholy adventure.\n\nRescue all hostages and eliminate the opposition.\n\nThis guy's antics are weird even by Belt Area standards, so only the dumbest locals have joined him. He did bring in his own Experts, though, so expect a tough fight when you encounter those. \n\nFortunately, the pissed off locals gave us excellent intel on where hostages are - and where they are not. Feel free to apply explosives everywhere else.


@briefing_covereddebris=We're tapped for another hostage rescue gig in the Belt-lands today, this time against some small-time insurgents looking to gain clout and move to the big boys table. Let's teach them the big boys rules then!\n\nExtract the hostage safely and preferably neutralize all threats.\n\nThe insurgents know someone is coming to rescue or steal their catch, so they fortified where they could and brought out all their gang. Most of them are not very dangerous in a fair fight, but the location is treacherous and can lead you in some dangerous crossfires.\n\nGo slow and methodically, don't rush to your death. 
@briefing_nightbird=We're tracking cell pings from possible henchmen of an arms dealer we want to bring in, and we might have a jackpot for tonight. You need to check this site and abduct whatever Person of Interest you can find.\n\nArrest and extract any HVT.\n\nThe location is secluded and deep in enemy territory, so the squad should be small and stealthy. This HVT - if present - is known to be skitish and will surely flee if something feels off. Cut his escape route and don't cause a ruckus until you're in position to act decisively. 

@briefing_jackofhearts=We're on high level arrest duty. Our target has built up his position within the insurgency by smuggling opium out of the country to pay for the organization’s activities, and put a little something aside for himself.\n\nEnter the HVT’s home and capture him.\n\nBy capturing this HVT, we will decapitate funding for the insurgents in the region. This house is well guarded by a mix of thugs recruited personally by the Broker, as well as veterans tasked to him for further protection. Remember, we can’t kill him as we need to interrogate him, but feel free to use flashbangs to your heart’s content. 
@briefing_queenofdiamonds=We're looking to catch an elusive bird tonight - one of the foreign players that sap the struggling Nowheraki state with their schemes. He rarely comes across the border - and we can't rendition him abroad, so don’t let this opportunity slip by. As a principal investor in Blackhead operations globally, he is here to meet with some Eastern European jihadis who have been training insurgent forces.\n\nCapture the HVT and eliminate all other enemies.\n\nThe condo is guarded by a small army of bodyguards, better trained and armed than Jihadis but not up to Western PMC standards.\n\nUse surprise, darkness and tactics to dominate the structure. And maybe pay a visit to the CCTV room. 
@briefing_kingofspades=This is unusual - we're here to pick up an old regime official - but he's coming in willingly. Guess he decided he's not a fan of the new-age insurgency. That, or he'd rather have US taxpayer money instead of Jihadi-induced mutilation. He called to us over unsecured cell - so you're not the only Uber dropping in.\n\nGet the Defector to the Rescue Zone.\n\nPoor bloke is already controllable by you, but he fears a hit on him is imminent - and that even his own guards are turning on him. Expect company, and treat all individuals as potential enemies.
@intel_kingofspades_VIP=This guy is cooperating and wants to be brought in safely. You can control him as a regular trooper, but don't trust him with weapons. 
@briefing_tenofclubs=A regional operations officer of the Insurgency is visiting an barracks hidden within the city. We were able to determine it’s location after tracking a stolen police truck from an ambushed Nowheraki checkpoint.\n\nCapture the HVT and neutralize any adversaries on the premises.\n\nThese guys are armed to the teeth and won’t give him over without a fight. Prepare to earn every inch of the compound in your push to get this guy. Our breachers give us the advantage of surprise, so be sure to use them to gain new angles on unsuspecting adversaries.
@briefing_twoofspades=We have a double date night with a pair of low level targets. These guys were good neighbours and felt safer to shelter in place after the invasion, with bribes, guns and occasional blackmail covering them - until now.\n\nCapture and evacuate both HVTs.\n\nThis is a night mission, but the enemy is expecting trouble. There will be guards, traps, and Reinforcements on Call. Plan accordingly, and don't give them the initiative. 
@briefing_offlimits=The hitherto unidentified leader of the Insurgency in the Northern Belt turns out to be hidden in plain sight - a wealthy land owner and regime advisor. We've tracked the perps after a bloody green on green event and it lead us straight to him.\n\nCapture and evacuate the HVT.\n\nThis mission is as important as it gets, but don't rush to your death. There is a small army currently on the property and we can't afford to wait for darkness.\n\nGo in through the back, use superior marksmanship and firepower to gain the upper hand and fight your way to the Evac Point in the front yard. 
@briefing_coolpalace=The Counter-Terrorism Minister - star of the new regime - has turned out to be an insurgent puppet-master. He capitalized on his clearance to sabotage our efforts and boost the Insurgency, while using  our ops to remove opponents from his board. It is now time to capture him too, before he knows the game is up.\n\nBreach the palace compound and bring in the HVT, alive.\n\nThe old Emirate-era palace is heavily guarded by private security and can only be approached in force by the front gate.\n\nSeek additional options and prevent the enemy from escaping via helicopter. 


@briefing_crisisonroutekilo=The snacks aren’t the only sketchy thing at this gas station. Earlier this morning a jihadi cell intercepted a bus and singled out an university student with the wrong books, beard size and ideas. Even more unfortunately, pressurized petroleum and suicide vests are a combination more explosive than the after effects of gas station sushi.\n\nNeutralize the hostiles before they execute the hostage or detonate their suicide vests.\n\nThere isn’t much room for a slow start to this op, once they know we are here, it’s a race to keep the student alive. The rear of the gas station may provide an alternate approach. Whatever you do, do it with violence and precision. 
@briefing_againsttheodds=You have a seemingly impossible task ahead of you. A recon drone recently uncovered an insurgent base deep in the badlands. We believe this is where they transported two Nowheraki politicians recently kidnapped.\n\nBreach the compounds defenses and secure the hostages.\n\nThis base is packed with insurgents, and our analysts have discovered a live feed of a prepared execution. This won’t be easy, but you are the last hope these men have. There are many open spaces and plenty of places the enemy can fight from. Make sure you have the right equipment not just for the rescue, but also to suppress the remaining jihadis.
@briefing_embassysiege=Yesterday, a local embassy outside the Green Zone was hit by jihadi forces. Most of the staff were able to extract themselves safely, however the insurgents managed to turn up with some hostages. These jihadis are heavily armed and have created fortified positions in the embassy.\n\nMake entry into the embassy and rescue the hostages.\n\nThis was an attack designed to generate propaganda, and we have reason to believe that the hostages will be executed if the hostage takers are pressed. Move quickly to clear the embassy and ensure everyone goes home.
@briefing_maniacsmansion=Insurgents have stormed the home of a key informant and have taken him and his son hostage. We have reason to believe that they are being interrogated currently so that the jihadis can discern the scope of the information they have provided us, but there is a high likelihood they will kill the hostages as soon as they are no longer needed.\n\nEnter the compound and rescue the hostages.\n\nYou have a lot of open space to clear before you can make entry, and it is jam packed with hostiles. Make sure you are using cover and concealment to out maneuver the enemy and avoid the suicide vest insurgents on the premises. 
@briefing_countrysidejackpot=City folk just don’t get it. People who live out here love the peace and quiet of the open fields and sparse neighbors. This also makes it an attractive hideout for those up to no good. We have discovered a jihadi propaganda cell operating out of a remote farm house in the countryside. They have hostages on the premises they are intent on executing.\n\nRescue the hostages or neutralize all the enemies.\n\nCurrently, the jihadis are unaware of our rescue attempt. Leverage this to gain the capitalize on surprise. The almost text book corner and center fed rooms make this a walk in the park, errr corn field. 
@briefing_ourmaninaccounting=Running a grocery store is hard work, it’s even harder when a terror cell is forcing you to give warehouse space to them as well. After weeks of feeding us information, it seems that the jihaids have figured out where the leak came from. Presently a cell has arrived to intimidate our man into realigning his allegiance.\n\nRescue our informant and bring him to the extraction unharmed.\n\nThere are many insurgents on site, and they will kill the informant if he tries to flee. They think they have the upper hand, so surprise is on our side. But if stealth isn’t your cup of tea, third world construction has gifted us with many breach-able walls.
@briefing_thehandover=You’d think the idea of backpacking through a war-torn country would naturally be a bad idea. Unfortunately, that didn’t stop an American college student from trying. Within a few hours into his hike he was intercepted by human traffickers who are intent on selling him to an insurgent group.\n\nRescue the hostages or neutralize all hostiles.\n\nOur informant, a local national named Fergie, is joining us so she can rescue one of her team that was captured by the same traffickers. While these guys want a sale, they will kill the hostage if they get the chance. The bridge venue isn’t helping things either, but it’s nothing smoke can’t fix. 
@briefing_fergieparty=Our friend Fergie dropped by a Jihadi meet and counted too many bad guys to chew. She was on her way out but spotted the unmistakable orange of hostages, so she phoned it in and retreated to the bathroom in wait for backup.\n\nRescue the hostages.\n\nThe insurgents guarding these hostages are highly trained and motivated, and we have reason to believe they have imbedded a suicide bomber with the hostages as a failsafe in the event of a rescue attempt. Fergie may be able to provide us with an added element of surprise, so keep her in mind as you make entry.
@briefing_vantagepoint=Two foreign journalists have been living in the apartment during their time reporting on the conflict. This morning, we received a call from their neighbors informing us that a jihadi cell paid them a visit and has been beating them all night long.\n\nBreach the apartment and rescue the two hostages.\n\nWe have reason to believe they will be executed if we do not intervene. The neighbors apartment at the end of the hall can and the sniper across the street are potential tools to help with the rescue, and mind the huge balcony and all-around glass walls.\n\nWhatever you do, finish it fast as these insurgents will slit throats as soon as they know you are here.

@briefing_firesale=You think darkness is your ally? Tonight it will be. We're hitting a car dealership, and the florescent lighting should make the tangos blind as bats to you creeping right up to those huge windows. But if they do see you, they might execute the hostages, and the showroom geometry isn't simple.\n\nEnter the dealership and rescue the hostages.\n\nJust because the jihadis inside are easy pickings for a turkey shoot doesn’t mean that there isn’t danger afoot - some patrols have been spotted in the car lot.\n\nDarkness may be your force multiplier - but you will need to spread out and cover the left side offices as well.
@briefing_mazerunners=A press briefing hasn’t been this fiery since a journalist threw a shoe at the US president. This morning, several Blackheads cells seized control of the foreign news office as many journalists were preparing for the weekly briefing.\n\nEnter the office and rescue the hostages or eliminate the enemy.\n\nThe insurgents present are highly motivated and trained, and many are equipped with suicide vests. As soon as they see you, they will attempt to kill the nearest hostage. So act quickly to save lives before it is too late!
@briefing_speedislife=There are many valid businesses throughout the country, but this call center is not one of them. It is however, still full of people who need our help. Insurgents morality police stormed it as part of their effort to “liberate” the country from western influences. The only thing they plan to liberate today are heads from necks.\n\nKill all enemies and rescue the hostages.\n\nWe have a sniper in place across the street, but the tempo of his shots are limited. You will need to capitalize on speed, surprise, and violence of action to gain the momentum and remind the jihadis that their extended warranty has come to an end.
@briefing_nightcall=We’ve tracked a missing informant to his house and he seems to have unruly guests. We owe him to get him back.\n\nEnter the home and rescue our informant.\n\nRemember in horror movies how the monster always kills the power to the house before creeping in and murdering everyone? Well now’s your chance to be it.\n\nThere are multiple entry points and fuse boxes to blackout the house and the lights in the yard. Stealth or extreme violence of action are your only options here. You can breach the walls with explosives, or become a tale for nightmares and silently clear the house. The choice is yours, and the moon is full. 
@briefing_doublerush=Hardcore Rescue mission on the plate tonight, boys. Two enemy-held structures lay opposite sides of the street, both hosting closely guarded hostages.\n\nLocate and rescue all 5 hostages.\n\nThe enemy is unalerted but you need to take down both Hot Rooms simultaneously, as they provide each other with mutual observation and covering fire. It's for you to decide how to spread the force and where to apply more.\n\nWe currently have intel on only 4 of the hostages, so mind the explosives and find the last one alive. 
@briefing_hallwayhell=The Jihadis have long squatted this old colonial-era building deep in the belt area, but intel was too sketchy to nuke them from orbit. Now we know they have hostages, so we're green to go in.\n\nLocate and rescue all hostages.\n\nThere are 10 known hostages, and we only have intel on some of them. You'll need to comb the structure methodically and find them all.\n\nThe enemy thinks they're beyond reach and are not in lockdown mode, but they have numbers and skills to match your force. Expect unpleasant encounters with Foreign Advisors and their Fanatical Friends, S-Vests included. 
@briefing_unaware=One of our local assets has embedded too far with the Nowheraki underground and the Insurgency decided to pay him an unfriendly visit. Fortunately, Fergie got to him in time with a warning, and they are currently locked in the office, outnumbered and outgunned.\n\nBring the Asset and his wife out alive.\n\nThe enemy has the villa under control and they are combing through the property to find the family. You will need to open a path to our assets and also recover the wife - she managed to hide in the workshop and is prepared - but not trained - to defend herself. 


@briefing_kamilpasha=An ONU beancounter tracking WMDs has been attracting way too much attention on himself in the wrong part of the city. We have orders to extract him safely and talk some sense into him.\n\nContact the VIP and get him out.\n\nOur intel suggests that Kill Teams have already been dispatched and Underhill has 30 seconds to live - unless you get to him first.

@briefing_urbanarea="Grunkle Zero-One", a too-cool chalk from an agency that doesn't exist got themselves into trouble on the exfil leg of their op. They are down one but entrenched to defend, and need a ride.\n\nHandshake the Allied team and get everyone out.\n\nThe area is as hostile as it gets, and the enemy has unlimited reinforcements at their disposal. Your Rescue Force is not that great, so fight your way in and recover the assets as soon as possible, but don't linger there or you'll be overrun.

@briefing_bridgeassault=Yesterday, Jihadi forces repelled an assault by the Nowheraki Army and cemented control over the only bridge across the Al Ayoos River. Without our control of the bridge, friendly forces to the east will be cut off from supplies.\n\nRecapture the bridge and eliminate all enemies.\n\nThere are some civilians in the area, so keep your ROEs in check. The insurgent cell guarding the bridge are hardline veterans, and will bring a hard fight to your troops. Ensure that you neutralize their listening post within the western building before capitalizing on our night vision to assault the bridge.
@briefing_tolltakers=Last night a bus transporting national police recruits was intercepted by a jihadi cell. They have taken the hostages to a compound deep in the mountains to create a propaganda video out of their execution.\n\nRescue the hostages or clear the compound.\n\nWe’ve heard rumors of this compound but haven’t been able to validate them until now. It’s the remnants of an old Soviet base cut deep into the cliff side. Clearing the enemy from it will be a challenge, as it’s highly guarded and well-lit with a machine gun nest holding down the main approach. Reach them before it is too late.
@briefing_raptordown=We have a JSOC ISR bird down in enemy territory, and the proximity of civilian population prevents an immediate "strike it from orbit" solution. We need to go in and destroy all sensitive tech before it's smuggled to our not-so-friends across the border.\n\nDestroy the drone sensors and extract your team safely.\n\nThis is Indian Country all right, and the nearby school is known as an Insurgent strongpoint that you'll have to take into account.\n\nExpect enemy reinforcements via the North Route, so position to block them and don't loitter in there more than its needed. Quick-React-In, then Quick-Pull-Out.
